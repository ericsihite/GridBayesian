# GridBayesian

Grid-based Bayesian Estimator made for tracking space junk in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This project is done under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Bewley in the University of California San Diego.

To run the file:
1. Edit the "main.cpp" and the derived class definitions in "GridBayesDerived.h".
2. Compile and run through "main.cpp"

Recorded data:
* Data recorded in the following format: [pdf, states[N_DIM]].
* The first line contains the following format: [n_list, n_major_pdf]. The first "n_major_pdf" lines contains the grids with non-trivial pdf setup in the simulation settings.
